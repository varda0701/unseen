# unseen
---
unseen is a web application that would help a user encrypt an image using a key. Whenever needed the user can use the decrypt feature using the same key, the encrypted image and a _.dat file_ given to the user at the time of encryption, to get the original image back.
The application does not store any of the user's data and hence is 100% secure.

## The Tech Stack

## Clone

## Build and Run

## Example
By following the above given steps to build and run, the image can be encrypted or decrypted as per the user requirements.

The process flow can be depicted as below:
STEP 1
    ![encryption process](frontend/img/1.jpg)
STEP 2
    ![decryption process](frontend/img/2.jpg)
    
## Algorithm Used
For carrying out the encryption/decryption process, the [**AES**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) algorithm with 256 bits key, since they are the most secure as of now.

## NIST Test Results
The testing of this ecryption/decryption implementation has been done with reference to the **NIST** standards and has given promising results of 100%.
